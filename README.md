# CODSOFT C++
<p>Hi everyone!</p>
<p>Here I have listed the 3 projects that I created during my internship at 'CodSoft' as a 'C++ Programming Intern'.</p>
<p>The 3 projects are as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Number Guessing Game:</b> It included creating a Number Guessing Game which will prompt the user to guess a random generated number and, on each step, provide the user with the info whether the guess was low or high.
</li>
  <li><b>Simple Calculator:</b> It included creating a Simple Calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division upon user's choice of two numbers and the operations to be performed.
</li>
  <li><b>Tic Tac Toe Game:</b> It included creating a Tic Tac Toe Game that can be played by two users. One will be marked X and the other would be 0. It has a functionality of saying that whether a game has ended (either a player has won or it ended as a draw) or it is still ongoing. Finally, it gives the users an option if they want to play it again.
</li>
</ul>
