# CODSOFT C++
<p>Hi everyone!</p>
<p>Here I have listed the 3 projects that I created during my internship at 'CodSoft' as a 'C++ Programming Intern'.</p>
<p>The 3 projects are as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Number Guessing Game:</b> It included creating a Number Guessing Game which will prompt the user to guess a random generated number and, on each step, provide the user with the info whether the guess was low or high.
</li>
</ul>
